# Library Management System

## Project Overview
This is a simple Java program that helps manage books in a library. It lets you:
- Add new books to the system
- See all available books
- Borrow and return books
- Edit or remove books
- View which books are currently borrowed

All book information is saved in a text file (all_books.txt) so your data isn't lost when you close the program. The system shows book details in a clean, easy-to-read format.
